# StreetEasier
Sean Browning

## Background
A code project to automate the task of finding a rental in NYC (ha.)   
It's unlikely I'll ever finish it, but it was fun to try things out.  

_All code provided as-is, and I take no responsibility for any negative consequences an end user may incur as a result of web scraping sites that might prefer you not do that._

I had a few main goals:  
- In lieu of a working API from Zillow / StreetEasy, easily compare listings that might meet my search criteria beyond what Zillow allows  
- Cross-reference potential listings against GEOapify/Google Maps API to see general connectivity, travel time to certain POIs  
- _(eventually)_ display these data, probably using Quarto
